# 🕵️ The Mystery of the Lost Gateway

This comic explains:

- why a Gateway may show `Programmed: False`
- what **GatewayConflict** really means
- why a Gateway **does not have its own IP**
- who actually controls traffic (GatewayClass / Controller)

📌 Read this if:
- you are working on **LAB 05**
- you see `ADDRESS: <none>` and think something is broken
- you are under CKAD exam pressure 😄
