# 🕵️ The Health Inspector - The Broken Shop

This comic explains the **Troubleshooting toolkit** in Kubernetes using the "Crime Scene Investigation" analogy.

## 🛍️ Mall Analogy

- **The Crime Scene** → A Pod that is `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Pending`.
- **CCTV Tapes** → `kubectl logs`. Watch what the clerk was doing right before the incident.
- **Security Logbook** → `kubectl describe`. See the Mall Manager's (Kubernetes) official reports on events like "Door Jammed" (ImagePullBackOff) or "Worker Fainted" (OOMKilled).
- **Walking Inside** → `kubectl exec`. Physically entering the shop to check the shelves and inventory.

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

Investigating a broken shop requires a step-by-step approach:
1.  **Check the Logbook (`describe`)** for infrastructure issues.
2.  **Review the CCTV (`logs`)** for application crashes.
3.  **Enter the Shop (`exec`)** for deep inspection.
