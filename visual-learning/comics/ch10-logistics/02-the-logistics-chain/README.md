# 📖 Comic Script (Text Version)

### Panel 1: Helm - The Store-in-a-Box
**Worker:** "Just unbox the standard kit with my specific order!"
**Narrator:** A mall worker stands next to a large shipping container labeled **'Helm Charts - Store-in-a-Box'**. They are unboxing a miniature, fully-furnished gift shop.
- **Helm Chart:** The shipping container (Standard Kit).
- **Values.yaml:** The worker's 'Order Form' (Specific customizations like colors or names).

### Panel 2: Kustomize - The Overlay Blueprint
**Architect:** "I'll just add my custom changes on top without altering the original plan."
**Narrator:** An architect places a transparent sheet of trace paper (**'Overlay/Kustomize'**) over a solid **'Base Blueprint'**. Instead of rewriting the whole plan, they just draw the changes on the sheet.
- **Base:** The original, standard blueprint.
- **Overlays:** The transparent sheets with environment-specific changes (Dev, Prod).

> **Key Takeaway:**
> - **Helm**: Use it when you want a complete, pre-packaged solution where you just fill in the blanks.
> - **Kustomize**: Use it when you want to keep your central blueprints "pure" and apply different adjustments for different mall locations.
