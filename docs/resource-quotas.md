### 4.8.2 Resource Quotas (The Department Budget)
A **Quota** is a total limit applied to a **Namespace**.
  - **Mall Analogy:** "The Food Court department is only allowed a total of 10 employees and 5000W of power."
  - **The Crucial Rule:** If a Quota is set on a department, **every worker** hired must have a defined budget (Requests/Limits) or Management will reject the application immediately.
