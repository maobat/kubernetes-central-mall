### 4.8.1 Requests vs. Limits
Before a worker (Pod) can be hired, they must declare their resource needs.
  - **Resource Requests (The Minimum):** "I need at least 1 desk and 250mW of power to even start working." The **Scheduler** uses this to find a building (Node) with enough room.
  - **Resource Limits (The Maximum):** "You can use more power if the mall has extra, but you are strictly cut off at 500mW."
