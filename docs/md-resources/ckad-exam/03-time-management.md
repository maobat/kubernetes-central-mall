# ⏱️ Time Strategy (THIS PASSES THE EXAM)

---

## 🕑 Total Time

- 2 hours
- ~15–20 tasks
- ~6–8 minutes per task

---

## 🎯 Golden Rule

> **If you’re stuck for 2 minutes, SKIP.**

Mark it mentally.
Move on.
Come back later.

---

## 🧠 Task Priority

1. Pods / ConfigMaps / Secrets
2. Deployments / Services
3. Jobs / CronJobs
4. Volumes / Probes
5. NetworkPolicies (last)

---

## 🔁 Workflow per Task

1. Read **only the last sentence**
2. Identify resource type
3. Decide: imperative or YAML
4. Execute
5. Verify (`kubectl get`)
6. Move on

---

## 🚫 Common Time Killers
